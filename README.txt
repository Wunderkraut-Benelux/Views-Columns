Description

This module provides a Views view style plugin. It allows you to split the rows in a view over a number of div containers. These can then be styled as i.e. floated columns with a fluid or fixed width. Views columns provides enough CSS classes for themers to get started.

Requirements

Depends on the Views module

Installation

* Enable Views columns in admin/build/modules
* Add/edit your view
* Set the style of the view to 'Columns'
* Configure the view to the number of columns you want
* Save your view

Now go check your rendered view and start theming.
